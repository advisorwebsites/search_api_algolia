# Algolia search with Search API
Drupal 8 version Search API implementation to Algolia

To install:
composer require algolia/algoliasearch-client-php
Then enable the module. 

I will have to look into a way to the download during install. But there seems to be some issues that need to be addressed here first https://www.drupal.org/node/2477789
